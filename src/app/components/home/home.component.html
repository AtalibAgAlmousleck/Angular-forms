      Forms are an integral part of a web application. Practically every
      application comes with forms to be filled in by the users

      >Angular forms are used to log in, update a profile, enter sensitive
      information, and perform many other data-entry tasks. In this article, you
      will learn about how to create a form and validate the information
      filled.</b

    <h3>Template-Driven Approach</h3>
    <p>
      In this method, the conventional form tag is used to create forms. Angular
      automatically interprets and creates a form object representation for the
      tag. Controls can be added to the form using the NGModel tag. Multiple
      controls can be grouped using the NGControlGroup module. A form value can
      be generated using the “form.value” object. Form data is exported as JSON
      values when the submit method is called. Basic HTML validations can be
      used to validate the form fields. In the case of custom validations,
      directives can be used. Arguably, this method is the simplest way to
      create an Angular App.
    </p>
    <h3>Reactive Form Approach</h3>
    <p>
      This approach is the programming paradigm oriented around data flows and
      propagation of change. With Reactive forms, the component directly manages
      the data flows between the form controls and the data models. Reactive
      forms are code-driven, unlike the template-driven approach. Reactive forms
      break from the traditional declarative approach. Reactive forms eliminate
      the anti-pattern of updating the data model via two-way data binding.
      Typically, Reactive form control creation is synchronous and can be unit
      tested with synchronous programming techniques.
